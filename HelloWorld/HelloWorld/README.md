## Description

A basic getting started program.

This version of Hello_World prints an incrementing count to the console UART and toggles an LED once every 500 ms.

## Setup

If using the Standard EvKit (EvKit_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Close jumper JP1 (LED1 EN).
-   Close jumper JP2 (LED2 EN).
-	Select "EvKit_V1" for _BOARD_ in "Makefile"

If using the Featherboard (FTHR_RevA):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-	Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-	Select "FTHR_RevA" for _BOARD_ in "Makefile"

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
Hello World!
count : 0
count : 1
count : 2
count : 3
```

You will also observe the LED (LED1 for EvKit_V1 or D1 for the Featherboard) blinking at a rate of 2Hz.
